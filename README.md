# CSE13S Repository

Assignments I completed for UCSC's CSE 13S Class - Computer Systems and C Programming. 

## Summary

I worked on assignments involving Sorting, Hamiltonian Paths, Huffman Coding, File Encryption and Decryption with RSA, and a Firewall-esque implementation to filter given words and phrases.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

In these assignments, I implemented various ADTs such as Nodes, Codes, Stacks, Graphs, Queues, Priority Queues, HashTables, BitVectors, Binary Search Trees, BloomFilters, and more. I also used various sorting algorithms - namely the insertion sort, shell sort, heap sort, and quick sort.
