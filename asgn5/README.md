# Assignment 5 - Huffman Coding

## Description of Program

In this assignment, I created a Huffman encoder that reads file input, finds the Huffman encoding of its contents, uses the encoder to encode the file, and the decoder to decode the file to its original state. Included in the program files are a variety of functions necessary to read input, create a node ADT, create a Huffman encoder, utilize a priority queue ADT, traverse the Huffman tree using a stack ADT, as well as decode the encoded file using the stack ADT and recursion. Also included in the encoder program are command line options that take in command line input to specify different variables as well as a decoder program that similarly takes in command line input for various options.

## Building the Program
